####A Leap Motion and Three.js audio player

This is a nice experiment: its aim is to mix Leap Motion and Three.js possibilities. I ended up creating a 3D space where you can play a virtual piano just using your hands. This project is currently using WAGE and WebAudioAPI.

NOTE: This is still a work in progress, no audio is currently available, nor any visible virtual piano. There will be both in the next weeks.
